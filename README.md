### Supports
- Contao 4.4.x and above
- We deliberately kept it to 4.4 because there might still be several older websites who want to have a one page theme on their existing website.

### Features
- This can render the <b>main articles</b> of all pages and their subpages!
- Renders page articles at 'n-th' level of site-structure.
- No template integration required.
- No additional JS required.
- No configuration required.

### Installation
- Use Contao-Manager for installation of this bundle
- Alternately, you can download this bundle and manually install at your own risk.
